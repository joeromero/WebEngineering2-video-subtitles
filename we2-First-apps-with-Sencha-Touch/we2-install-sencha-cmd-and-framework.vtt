00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.842
In this video we'll cover the installation of the Sencha Command tool and the Sencha Touch framework.

2
00:00:07.092 --> 00:00:28.962
1. Open a terminal window
2. Check if Debian installation is up to date:
$ sudo apt-get update
(Note: the dollar sign ($) serves to indicate the command line, don't type it)

3
00:00:29.212 --> 00:00:34.042
3. Enter password for sudo: 
$ developer

4
00:00:34.292 --> 00:00:46.562
(if there are updates, they are installed ...)

5
00:00:46.812 --> 00:01:03.002
For Sencha Command we have to install the Ruby compiler, because Sencha Cmd needs Ruby for the CSS compiler (SASS/Compass).

6
00:01:03.252 --> 00:01:15.162
To install Ruby:
$ sudo apt-get install ruby

7
00:01:15.412 --> 00:01:18.912
Confirm question if you want to continue:
$ y

8
00:01:19.162 --> 00:01:26.482
(Packet files are installed...)

9
00:01:26.732 --> 00:01:37.802
Now download Sencha Command from the Sencha website at:
http://www.sencha.com/products/sencha-cmd/download

10
00:01:38.052 --> 00:01:53.602
For the Debian installation, click on Linux 32-bit. The respective files is downloaded.

11
00:01:53.852 --> 00:01:59.202
If you have a slow connection, time for a coffee ...

12
00:01:59.452 --> 00:02:09.442
Change into the download folder:
$ cd Downloads

13
00:02:09.692 --> 00:02:12.962
Check if the files are there:
$ ls

14
00:02:13.212 --> 00:02:44.882
Unzip the archive:
$ unzip SenchaCmd-4.0.2.67-linux.run.zip

15
00:02:45.132 --> 00:02:48.762
The zip file is unzipped.

16
00:02:49.012 --> 00:02:59.562
We have to change the execution rights on the file before we can execute it.

17
00:02:59.812 --> 00:03:03.312
Change the rights
$ chmod 755 SenchaCmd.4.0.2.67-linux.run

18
00:03:03.562 --> 00:03:08.002
Check again:
$ ls
The file is now executable.

19
00:03:08.252 --> 00:03:20.002
Now its important that Sencha Command is not installed under sudo.
Therefore, exit terminal:
$ exit

20
00:03:20.252 --> 00:03:22.882
Open a new terminal.

21
00:03:23.132 --> 00:03:36.602
Change into Downloads folder again:
$ cd Downloads

22
00:03:36.852 --> 00:03:39.042
Show folder contents:
$ ls

23
00:03:39.292 --> 00:04:09.642
Execute the file:
$ ./SenchaCmd-4.0.2.67-linux.run
(./ is important!)

24
00:04:09.892 --> 00:04:23.482
The installation starts and the setup dialog appears:
- Click "Next".
- Check "I accept the agreement".
- Click "Next".

25
00:04:24.732 --> 00:04:26.922
- Accept Installation Directory, click "Next".

26
00:04:27.172 --> 00:04:30.672
-Click "Next" again on Ready to Install.

27
00:04:30.922 --> 00:04:39.362
Sencha Cmd is installed ...

28
00:04:39.612 --> 00:04:42.242
Click "Finish" to finish the installation.

29
00:04:42.492 --> 00:04:45.992


30
00:04:42.492 --> 00:04:54.362
Now let's test if Sencha can be called:
(Note: KQC tries to call sencha in the download folder and in the home folder but since that does not work, we don't need to follow that procedure)

31
00:04:54.612 --> 00:05:15.122
Let's close the terminal window again:
$ exit

32
00:05:15.372 --> 00:05:24.602
Then, open a new terminal:

33
00:05:24.852 --> 00:05:28.352
Type 
$ sencha

34
00:05:28.602 --> 00:05:42.842
Sencha is installed.
As you can see, the tool offers quite a few options, categories, commands etc.

35
00:05:43.092 --> 00:05:47.322
Next, we will install the Sencha Touch framework:

36
00:05:53.072 --> 00:05:58.762
To download Sencha Touch, visit 
http://www.sencha.com/products/touch/download

37
00:05:59.012 --> 00:06:11.642
It's important that you choose the open source version, which is available unter the GNU GPLv3 license (not the commercial version!)

38
00:06:11.892 --> 00:06:26.842
Click on Download and download of the package will start...
Depending on your internet connection, have a cup of coffee while the download continues ...

39
00:06:27.092 --> 00:06:33.882
In terminal, change into the Download folder again:
$ cd Downloads

40
00:06:34.132 --> 00:06:48.722
List the content of the folder:
$ ls
The Sencha Touch SDK is there: sencha-touch-2.3.1a-gpl.zip

41
00:06:48.972 --> 00:07:12.642
Unzip the file:
$ unzip sencha-touch-2.3.1a-gpl.zip

42
00:07:12.892 --> 00:07:21.602
The package is unzipped...

43
00:07:21.852 --> 00:07:30.242
Show the contents of the Download folder.
$ ls
You will see a new folder called "touch-2.3.1"

44
00:07:30.492 --> 00:07:35.522
Now, we can create our project structure.

45
00:07:35.772 --> 00:07:39.522


46
00:07:39.772 --> 00:07:57.122
Change into the touch-2.3.1 folder:
$ cd touch-2.3.1

47
00:07:57.372 --> 00:08:00.872
Show folder contents:
$ ls

48
00:08:01.122 --> 00:08:05.242
Now, we'll generate our first Sencha Touch project.

49
00:08:05.492 --> 00:08:25.482
To do so. enter the following command:
sencha -sdk (path_to_SDK) generate app (app_name) (path_to_app), i.e.
$ sencha -sdk /home/developer/Downloads/touch-2.3.1/ generate app Helloworld /home/developer/example/helloworld

50
00:08:25.732 --> 00:08:33.922
The new app is generated ...

51
00:08:34.172 --> 00:08:55.802
Now, we will call the Sencha Cmd web server.First, we have to change into the project folder

52
00:08:56.052 --> 00:09:05.242


53
00:09:05.492 --> 00:09:35.042
$ cd /home/developer/example/helloworld
(this is the short version, KQC does the same in individual steps)

54
00:09:35.292 --> 00:09:46.482
Start web server:
$ sencha web start

55
00:09:46.732 --> 00:09:51.322
The jetty server is started ...

56
00:09:51.572 --> 00:09:58.642
Let's change to a browser ...

57
00:09:58.892 --> 00:10:19.762
Call localhost on port 1841 in the browser address line:
localhost:1841

58
00:10:20.012 --> 00:10:26.042
Your newly generated app is opened ....

59
00:10:26.292 --> 00:10:30.762
Brief check:
Click on "Get Started", back to "Welcome".

60
00:10:31.012 --> 00:10:34.512
Finished!
