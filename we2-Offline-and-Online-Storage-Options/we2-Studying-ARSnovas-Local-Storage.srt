00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,722
We will now examine how the Local Storage is filled during a session and how it remains available after the session is finished.

1
00:00:17,052 --> 00:00:30,402
Let's have a look at the entries in the section Local Storage.

2
00:00:30,652 --> 00:00:43,402
The first 11 entries beginning with the strange key have been generated by Sencha Cmd. 

3
00:00:43,652 --> 00:00:55,162
This key is a prefix to the domain and the JavaScript file, it serves to identify the application.

4
00:00:55,412 --> 00:01:18,482
The JavaScript files are stored in the Local Storage, so that they don't have to be called again when another view needs them as well.

5
00:01:18,732 --> 00:01:26,362
The last four entries are the application specific keys.

6
00:01:26,612 --> 00:01:34,202
We will now go through the application and observe live how the local cache is being filled.

7
00:01:34,452 --> 00:01:42,402
I will enter the application as "Teacher". Please observe the changes on the right.

8
00:01:42,652 --> 00:01:51,482
You see that key "role" has been added and the value for role is "1". The value "1" in this case represents the role "Teacher".

9
00:01:51,732 --> 00:02:00,562
If we go back and enter the app as "Student", the value for role changes to "0".

10
00:02:00,812 --> 00:02:08,442
KQC goes back and selects role "Teacher" again.

11
00:02:08,692 --> 00:02:25,242
KQC signs in with his Google account ...

12
00:02:25,492 --> 00:02:27,642


13
00:02:27,892 --> 00:02:42,122
On the right, you can now see that the value for the key “login” is now set to the email address connected with the Google account.

14
00:02:42,372 --> 00:02:51,722
KQC selects a session.

15
00:02:51,972 --> 00:03:10,322
The result: The values for sessionid, sessionname, keyword and shortName are stored in Local Storage.

16
00:03:10,572 --> 00:03:20,202
KQC goes to Lecturer Questions, selects a question and taps Feedback: -> No entries in Local Storage.

17
00:03:20,452 --> 00:03:38,042
If we close the app the again, none of the data is left, apart from the key/value pair for login.

18
00:03:38,292 --> 00:03:50,792
There is a message informing us that no active user is logged in anymore.
