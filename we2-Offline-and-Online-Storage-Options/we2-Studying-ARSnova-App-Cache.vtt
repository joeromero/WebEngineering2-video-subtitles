00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.242
Let's examine the application cache using ARSnova as an example.

2
00:00:07.492 --> 00:00:18.242
On the left, in Google Chrome Browser, we have loaded the ARSnova app.

3
00:00:18.492 --> 00:00:24.162
On the right, we have the Chrome Developer Tools.

4
00:00:24.412 --> 00:00:34.682
First, let me show how to inform the browser about the manifest file.

5
00:00:34.932 --> 00:00:44.202
You define the manifest file as attribute of the <html> element:

6
00:00:44.452 --> 00:00:51.442
<html manifest="arsnova.manifest">

7
00:00:51.692 --> 00:01:03.602
Now, when we switch to the "Resources" tab, we'll see all storage options of an HTML 5 app.

8
00:01:03.852 --> 00:01:21.562
1. Web SQL (I mentioned in the first video that not all browsers support this SQL Light database). Web SQL is not used by ARSnova

9
00:01:21.812 --> 00:01:29.202
2. IndexedDB, used by Firefox and Internet Explorer (not used here, either)

10
00:01:29.452 --> 00:01:38.442
ARSnova doesn't use any of these client-side SQL or NoSQL databases.

11
00:01:38.692 --> 00:01:49.002
3. Local Storage: ARSnova does use Local Storage and there are some entries in it.

12
00:01:49.252 --> 00:01:55.722
3. Session Storage: There are no entries.

13
00:01:55.972 --> 00:02:11.202
4. Cookies: ARSnova uses conventional cookies 
(At the moment, there are no entries)

14
00:02:11.452 --> 00:02:19.162
(KQC  reloads the app to generate a cookie ...) Ah, now there is one.

15
00:02:19.412 --> 00:02:25.962
In this cookie, the authentication data is stored.

16
00:02:26.212 --> 00:02:31.722
5. Application Cache.

17
00:02:31.972 --> 00:02:36.722
Here the entries in the Application Cache.

18
00:02:36.972 --> 00:02:47.322
The Manifest File is located in the master folder and is called arsnova.manifest.

19
00:02:47.572 --> 00:02:52.082
The list shows all entries in the Application Cache.

20
00:02:52.332 --> 00:03:15.282
When the app is initially loaded, all resources are loaded. On the second call, all these resources are available locally and don't need to be reloaded over the internet.

21
00:03:15.532 --> 00:03:27.282
With Sencha Cmd it's easy define which files will go into the manifest file.

22
00:03:27.532 --> 00:03:30.082
Let's have a quick look.

23
00:03:30.332 --> 00:03:56.002
The resources that should go into the app cache are defined in the file "app.json".

24
00:03:56.252 --> 00:04:04.282
This file is important for you as a developer, so have a closer look at it.

25
00:04:04.532 --> 00:04:08.802
In this file, you define the name space of the app.

26
00:04:09.052 --> 00:04:16.402
You can also define if the app is a Single Page App (SPA) and many more things.

27
00:04:16.652 --> 00:04:27.042
You can define, which Javascript files you want concatenated and minified.

28
00:04:27.292 --> 00:04:36.402
You can define the CSS files that are to be concatenated and minified.

29
00:04:36.652 --> 00:04:44.562
And finally you can define the resources that should go into the cache manifest file:

30
00:04:44.812 --> 00:04:48.312
In this case: The index.html, the favicon icon, JavaScript files, external (third party) JavaScript files and other resources like css-files, images etc.
