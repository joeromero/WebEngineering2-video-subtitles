00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,882
Let's have a look at the first important step towards developing an app:

1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:18,042
We need to ask ourselves, what our client and the future user of our app really want.

2
00:00:18,292 --> 00:00:22,042
We need to perform a Use Case Analysis.

3
00:00:22,292 --> 00:00:37,562
According to a study by Barry BÃ¶hm, 80% of all commercial software projects failed due to this most critical part of software development

4
00:00:37,812 --> 00:00:49,842
because the people involved don't ask if they implement what the user wants.

5
00:00:50,092 --> 00:01:00,922
The developer as a stranger to the conceptual world of the user didn't involve the user in the development process nor ever ask if what was being developed corresponded with what the user expected.


6
00:01:01,172 --> 00:01:27,402
Those projects were more concerned with acquiring an order, with implementing a software quickly rather than involving the end user in the process to make sure that the development was still in line with user requirements.

7
00:01:27,652 --> 00:01:49,242
This cartoon here has a long tradition in software engineering. The original was first published in a research paper at the beginning of the 1990s

8
00:01:53,242 --> 00:01:56,742
It serves to illustrate that the user is completely left out of the development process.


9
00:01:56,992 --> 00:02:26,842
Usually, sales, marketing and project management are the only people in touch with user trying to find out what the user wants

10
00:02:02,992 --> 00:02:02,992
while the developers are left behind to implement what they think they understand to be the assignment. 

11
00:02:32,592 --> 00:02:39,592
The usability of the result will greatly differ depending on who documents a project, who is the domain expert.- marketing or engineering

12
00:02:40,842 --> 00:02:57,922
Marketing on one side, Engineering on the other - the result is likely not be be usable

13
00:02:58,882 --> 00:03:08,672
The process continues during manufacturing, something has to be developed, deadlines have to be met.

14
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:15,422
But will the implementation meet the requirements?

15
00:03:15,672 --> 00:03:26,962
In the end, it is left to the maintenance people to somehow make the software work.

16
00:03:27,212 --> 00:03:35,162
The development of the ARSnova Audience Response System was no different from the processes described before.

17
00:03:35,412 --> 00:03:53,762
The only difference was that this student project was supervised by university teachers (mainly me) who took the part of users and who  could intervene and get the project back on track.

18
00:03:54,012 --> 00:04:00,682
But whenever I wasn't there to supervise the project, the development went its own way.

19
00:04:00,932 --> 00:04:06,162
However, in the end we got it right

20
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:13,402
And the user manual proves that we got it right:

21
00:04:13,652 --> 00:04:20,082
It documents the application domain

22
00:04:20,332 --> 00:04:23,832
About ARSnova: What is it?

23
00:04:24,082 --> 00:04:31,082
And then goes on to describe the different use cases in the different roles.

24
00:04:31,332 --> 00:04:38,242
Audience Response Systems are simple in that there are two roles only:  students and teachers.

25
00:04:38,492 --> 00:04:46,962
The individual use cases are shown using screenshots of the app

26
00:04:47,212 --> 00:04:50,712
as I will show you in a minute.

27
00:04:50,962 --> 00:05:07,842
 Please have a look at the course material regarding use cases because it is vital to understand what use cases are.

28
00:05:08,092 --> 00:05:11,592
You have to ask who does what and when, what are the prerequisites,

29
00:05:11,842 --> 00:05:17,202
what is the result after an action has been performed.

30
00:05:17,452 --> 00:05:26,762
I recommend that you read the Wikipedia article about uses cases.

31
00:05:27,012 --> 00:05:32,962
Our students have to study use case analysis and domain modelling for oever three month

32
00:05:33,212 --> 00:05:37,002
but I have my doubts as to whether this concept is really always understood.

33
00:05:37,252 --> 00:05:49,752
However, the ARSnova manual describes the different use cases.

34
00:05:50,002 --> 00:05:58,362
The uses cases include the objects that are manipulated

35
00:05:58,612 --> 00:06:00,842
and those objects are the domain objects.

36
00:06:01,092 --> 00:06:07,042
In the homework assignment, you were asked to find these domain objects:

37
00:06:11,042 --> 00:06:24,482
To take the manual, work through ALL the use cases and analyze the HTTP traffic

38
00:06:24,732 --> 00:06:28,232
using the Firefox Add-ons Firebug or RESTclient.

39
00:06:28,482 --> 00:06:39,602
analyze the methods that are used, the URLs of thoses resources and try to find the main resources.

40
00:06:39,852 --> 00:06:44,000
Cut.
We will now have a look at the manual.

41
00:06:44,352 --> 00:06:55,122
The ARSnova manual is one of the few manuals really based on uses cases.

42
00:06:55,372 --> 00:07:05,562
and describes the step-by-step procedures for each use case based on the screenshots of each individual action.

43
00:07:05,812 --> 00:07:13,082
First, there is the project vision that is at the start of each software project.

44
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:21,362
The project vision is later transformed into a specification that describes the features of the app.

45
00:07:21,612 --> 00:07:27,762
Next, there is an overview of the GUI elements

46
00:07:28,012 --> 00:07:40,802
in the footer,

47
00:07:41,052 --> 00:07:45,002
in the header and in the content area.

48
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:56,402
Now, let's have a look at the use cases in the role of a student:

49
00:07:56,652 --> 00:08:06,002
Login and logout are not specific to ARSnova because these actions are common to all closed systems.

50
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:13,042
Therefore, they are not uses cases in the strict sense but nevertheless important to using the app.

51
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:24,242
The first use case is "Give Feedback".

52
00:08:24,492 --> 00:08:28,482
This use case corresponds to the first domain object "feedback".

53
00:08:28,732 --> 00:08:37,442
However, Feedback might not be a RESTful HTTP API domain object

54
00:08:40,692 --> 00:08:53,842
You will not find it there.
But from the point of view of the application it is a feedback system, feedback as a concept is one of the central domain concepts.

55
00:08:54,092 --> 00:08:57,592
The individual steps of each use case are numbered.

56
00:08:57,842 --> 00:09:01,342
1. Tap Give Feedback.

57
00:09:01,592 --> 00:09:25,242
Next: The result of performing the action, i.e. the next state in the client. The manual always shows the corresponding views in the app as screenshots.


58
00:09:25,492 --> 00:09:37,322
What is not shown here: What happens if the user enters wrong input, if requirements are not fulfilled, e.g. calling an URL without authentication etc.

59
00:09:37,572 --> 00:09:50,562
then performing these actions is not possible according to the specification.

60
00:09:50,812 --> 00:09:59,082
There are of course other use cases: Questions and Answers 

61
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:02,832
from the point of view of student and teacher,

62
00:10:03,082 --> 00:10:06,582
different question types,

63
00:10:06,832 --> 00:10:12,202
questions of the teacher during a lecture

64
00:10:12,452 --> 00:10:18,002
preparations questions before a lecture starts,

65
00:10:18,252 --> 00:10:28,002
And as the last use case here: Statistics

66
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:41,522
Now, lets have a look if there are other uses cases in the role "Teacher".

67
00:10:41,772 --> 00:10:52,722
The application case "Presentation Mode" allows the teacher to show questions to the audience during a lecture.

68
00:10:52,972 --> 00:11:22,972
This mode includes presenting the questions and the possible answers and also to have a look at the question statistics.
